## Description
This project is a crime search app that allows users to search for crimes in their area. The user can search using simple postcode or by using a list of them separated by commas. The app will then display the crimes that have been committed in the area.

## EsLint
This project uses EsLint to check the code for any errors, and to make sure that the code is written in a consistent way.

## How to use the app
The application is composed of a single page where the user can search for a postcode. If the postcode is valid, the app will display the crimes that have been committed in the area. 
The user can also search for multiple postcodes by separating them with commas. The app will then display the crimes that have been committed in the area.

When a postcode has been searched, it will be automatically added to the list of history search list. The user can then click on any of them to display the crimes that have been committed in the area. He can also detele any of them by clicking on the delete button.

A clear button is also available to clear the search input, the history list and the crimes list that was displayed before.
